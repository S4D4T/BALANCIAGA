                <h2>CURRENT DESIGNER OF BALENCIAGA</h2>
                <p>
                    Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia is the current designer of Balenciaga (alongside Vetements), stating that his approach to the brand is to deconstruct something in order to create something else – “destruct to create.” He cites his work pattern to be influenced by sportswear aesthetics, particularly focusing on the modernity of comfort, functionality and technicality to create an aesthetically pleasing image.

                    <p>Perfumer who created this composition is Olivier Polge of IFF. Balenciaga Paris is not a romantic floral fragrance, but created with a dose of the urban and the traditional with nuances of metal effects. Its composition is characterized as a chypre floral with accentuated violet.</p>
